ENN-C++ Deployment Package
==========================

Generated: $(date)
Host: $(hostname)
Compiler: $(g++ --version | head -1)
Eigen Version: 3.4.0
OpenMP: $([ "${OMP_DISABLED}" = "1" ] && echo "Disabled" || echo "Enabled")

Files:
- committor_train: Committor function learning demo
- seq_demo_bptt: Sequence learning with BPTT demo  
- tests/: Validation test suite
- run_tests.sh: Run all validation tests
- run_demos.sh: Run demo applications

Usage on A100:
1. ./run_tests.sh    # Validate installation
2. ./run_demos.sh    # Run performance demos

Integration:
- Use committor_train for BICEP trajectory learning
- Extend for FusionAlpha committor prior generation
- Modify hyperparameters in source for specific tasks

Performance Notes:
- Optimized for x86-64 with native instruction set
- OpenMP parallelization for multi-core utilization
- Expects 8-16 GB RAM for large datasets
